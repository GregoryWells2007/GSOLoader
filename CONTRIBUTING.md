There are two different types of contributions in the project ones that change how the loader works to make it faster or more reliable and ones that change how the language is specified and there are two different ways of contacting me about this
  - Ones that change how the loader works
      If you want to make a change to the loader that makes it better or more reliabe then just make a pull request and fill out thew description to tell me why you changes such things
      I may not add your pull request and if I do not then I will make sure to tell you why most of the time it will be because this project is always changing

  - Ones that change thre core language spec
      If you want to change the language spec then you will need to email me at gregowells07@gmail.com about your change to the specifacation and I will try key work being try to get back to you about your changes
      Unless I love your change then I will try to have a conversation about your change and how we could integrate it into a future version of the language
