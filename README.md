<h3 style="text-align: center;">Custom File format that I made</h3>

## Loader Spec Support
> C++

## Future plans
> Loader Defined Objects
>> Stuff like enums that need to be defined in something like a header and then the loader and figure out what to do with them
>
> More types
>> booleans
>>> I don't know how to missed this in my first implementation 
>
>> siron object files
>>> You can import other files as siron objects so you could only have one master file and then sub files
>
>> Redo list
>>> I want to fix lists so that they can use any data type not the 4 basic types
